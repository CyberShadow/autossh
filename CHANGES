Version 1.2e

- check for attempt to use -f flag; exit as error
- if AUTOSSH_GATETIME is 0, then disable any of the startup
  failure bailouts, and just retry
- set SO_REUSEADDR on listening socket (Jedi One's suggestion)
- show port number in some error messages
- note in man page and README about -M 0 turning port monitoring off
- remove duplicate include of sys/socket.h

Version 1.2d

- AIX support (thanks to Stefan Rodenstein)
- fix argument rewrite bug when using AUTOSSH_PORT (thanks
  to Peter Williams)
- log pid of ssh child just after fork

Version 1.2c

- use Marcus Friedl's suggestion to simply connect to "127.0.0.1" 
  rather than "localhost", as not really using IPv6 anyway. And this
  gets rid of annoying ipv6 localhost message on Solaris at least.
- support for MacOS X using Greg Parker's fakepoll.

Version 1.2b

(Thanks to Simon Easter for bug reports and trials)

- fix file descriptor leak
- setsockopt()'s don't work for Solaris either. Give up on them.
- set close-on-exec for read socket so will be closed when
  ssh executed
- do shutdown() before close() (paranoia)
- close read socket before exit
- pull read socket open and close up out of ssh_run()
- cosmetic changes to some loops, get rid of newlines in some
  errlog strings.

Version 1.2a

- setsockopt() will not set timeouts on socket read/write ops
  under Linux 2.2 kernels (and earlier, I presume). So unless
  someone tells me we really need them, I've #ifdef'd  the
  setsockopt()s out for Linux.
- check value of fd returned by accept().
- Oh, there's a man page now. Unfortunately, it doesn't render 
  for Solaris. Sorry, Solaris users are still stuck with the
  README.

Version 1.2

- Major restructuring of code, mostly to support the change to 
  a loop of forwarded ports to test the network connection.
- Incremental back off on rate of connection attempts when
  there are rapid failures to establish/maintain a connection.

Version 1.1b

- change handling of ssh exit status
- introduce "starting gate" time: ssh process that dies too
  early is deemed not to have made it out of the starting
  gate, and autossh exits.

Version 1.1a

- fix race after failure to exec ssh where parent will
  loop attempting to restart
- add -V version flag
- use strtoul() for environment option parsing
- drop useless intermediate function ssh_setwatch()

Version 1.1
