Version 1.2b

(Thanks to Simon Easter for bug reports and trials)

- fix file descriptor leak
- setsockopt()'s don't work for Solaris either. Give up on them.
- set close-on-exec for read socket so will be closed when
  ssh executed
- do shutdown() before close() (paranoia)
- close read socket before exit
- pull read socket open and close up out of ssh_run()
- cosmetic changes to some loops, get rid of newlines in some
  errlog strings.

Version 1.2a

- setsockopt() will not set timeouts on socket read/write ops
  under Linux 2.2 kernels (and earlier, I presume). So unless
  someone tells me we really need them, I've #ifdef'd  the
  setsockopt()s out for Linux.
- check value of fd returned by accept().
- Oh, there's a man page now. Unfortunately, it doesn't render 
  for Solaris. Sorry, Solaris users are still stuck with the
  README.

Version 1.2

- Major restructuring of code, mostly to support the change to 
  a loop of forwarded ports to test the network connection.
- Incremental back off on rate of connection attempts when
  there are rapid failures to establish/maintain a connection.

Version 1.1b

- change handling of ssh exit status
- introduce "starting gate" time: ssh process that dies too
  early is deemed not to have made it out of the starting
  gate, and autossh exits.

Version 1.1a

- fix race after failure to exec ssh where parent will
  loop attempting to restart
- add -V version flag
- use strtoul() for environment option parsing
- drop useless intermediate function ssh_setwatch()

Version 1.1
